 <h2>Practical - Introduction to WebGL with Three.js</h2>
 <p>In this practical you are provided with a simple outline program that initialises a WebGL canvas, sets up some simple scenes and draws a triangle.  
    <ol>
	  <li><b>Complete the parallelogram: </b>Add a point to the list of vertices and update the triangleGeometry to draw a parallelogram.  
	 Can you work out what point to add?  
	       Why does adding one point draw a whole triangle?</li>
    <li><b>Different configurations of the triangles: </b>There are different ways to draw the parallelogram. Can you figure out all of them? From the perspective of computer graphics/visualization, 
	which configuration do you prefer? Explain why. </li>    
	<li><b>Visualize the parallelogram in wireframe: </b>Display the parallelogram in wireframe. </li>
    <li><b>Change the colour: </b>Change the colour of the parallelogram to red. </li>
	<li><b>Change the field of view: </b>What will happen after the field of view of the camera has been changed from 45 degrees to 75 degrees? </li>
	<li><b>Change the far clipping place: </b>What will happen after the far clipping plane has been changed from 100 to 1000?</li>
